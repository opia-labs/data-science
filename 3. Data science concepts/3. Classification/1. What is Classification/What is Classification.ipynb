    "### What is Classification\n",
    "Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. In Classification, a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the Classification algorithm is to identify the category of a given dataset, and these algorithms are mainly used to predict the output for the categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best example of an ML classification algorithm is **Email Spam Detector**.\n"
